<h1>Welcome To Saida's Programming Portfolio</h1>
           <h2>Welcome To My Page!</h2>
           <p>This webpage is about the CSC106 course I am taking this fall. I am a freshmen at The University Of Rhode Island.
               This CSC course is called "The Joy Of Progamming". I will be taking this course as an introduction class into
               Computer Science. I will be creating Webpages like this one and many others.</p>
